TODO: Add README.md

DONE: Add caching mechanism for the previously accessed Node and it's index to improve efficiency (accessing a close node to the previous one accessed is a common thing to do)
DONE: Add compiler-features based in the demo
DONE: Remove unecessary memcpy function calls (just cast the result and set it)
DONE: Improve the time complexity for the function 'LinkedList_sort'
DONE: Add comments documentation
DONE: Improve complexity by checking if index is closer to head or tail in 'LinkedList_insert_at', 'LinkedList_remove_at' and 'LinkedList_get_at'

CANCELLED: Give the developer access for underlying Node datatype, and the ability to work with the nodes (this will help improve the efficiency)
CANCELLED: Refactor code via supported compiler features
